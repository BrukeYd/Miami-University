            <p>GOAL: $150,000,000</p>
            <p>A new vision to unify and coordinate healthcare and science education
                across the University offeres a bold opportunity to shape our impact 
                in the clinical health Sciences. The field of physician assistants is 
                predicted to grow by one-third by 2026, and we plan to meet that need 
                with innovative, ethical, best-in-class graduates. New programs, infrastructure,
                and talent all contribute to this transformative potential as Miami leads 
                forward in the science and practice of healthcare.

            <h2>Digital Innovation and Technology</h2>
            <p>GOAL: $100,000,000</p>
            <p>The world's data doubles every two years. At this staggering pace,
                it's no longer enough to keep current - we must anticipate the growth, 
                speed, and direction of the digital universe. A transdiscipliary program
                in data science and digital innovation will bring together multiple departments,
                while a new data science building will serve as a launch pad for research,
                dialogue, and a deeper understanding of  how the digital universe continually 
                shapes our world. This isn't simply a new program, it is a reinvention of 
                what education can be - and what it will become.
